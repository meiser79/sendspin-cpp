/**
 * @brief Abstract base class for Sendspin connections (server-initiated or client-initiated)
 *
 * This class represents a single connection to a Sendspin server. It manages connection state,
 * time synchronization, message buffering, and the hello handshake. Derived classes implement
 * the actual transport mechanism (e.g., incoming WebSocket server connection or outgoing client).
 *
 * The hub owns connection instances and uses callbacks to receive notifications about messages,
 * handshake completion, and disconnection events.
 *
 * Key responsibilities:
 * - Abstract base for platform-specific WebSocket transports (server and client variants)
 * - Owns and drives the time filter (Kalman-based NTP-style synchronization)
 * - Manages the reassembly payload buffer for fragmented WebSocket frames
 * - Tracks hello handshake state (client_hello_sent / server_hello_received)
 *
 * Usage:
 * 1. Construct a concrete subclass (SendspinServerConnection or SendspinClientConnection)
 * 2. Set the on_connected_cb, on_disconnected_cb, on_json_message_cb, and on_binary_message_cb
 *    callbacks
 * 3. Call start() to initialize the transport and begin connecting
 * 4. Call loop() periodically to drive the state machine and process events
 * 5. Call send_text_message() to send JSON messages to the peer
 * 6. Call disconnect() to send a goodbye message and close the connection
 *
 * @code
 * // Concrete subclass provided by the platform layer
 * auto conn = std::make_unique<SendspinClientConnection>(url, config);
 * conn->on_connected_cb = [](SendspinConnection* c) { c->send_text_message(hello_json, {}); };
 * conn->on_json_message_cb = [](SendspinConnection* c, const char* d, size_t n, int64_t t) {...};
 * conn->on_disconnected_cb = [](SendspinConnection* c) { handle_disconnect(); };
 * conn->start();
 * // Call conn->loop() from a periodic task
 * @endcode
